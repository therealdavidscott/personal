                <li><strong>November 8th, 2024</strong> - I had an incredible time at Princeton‚Äôs Business Today 
                International Conference, engaging with top CEOs and talented students while gaining valuable 
                industry insights. A highlight was discussing my analysis of Marriott with its CEO, Anthony 
                Capuano. Grateful for this experience and excited to apply these insights to my work in 
                information systems and cybersecurity!</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>August 10th, 2024</strong> - I finished my internship with Forvis Mazars, 
                having gained experience transforming incoming client data into ECS format by mapping 
                data fields to standardized ECS fields, ensuring consistent representation and enhancing 
                tool compatibility. Also worked with Penetration Testing Services 
                and SentinelOne to identify weaknesses within client systems. </li>
